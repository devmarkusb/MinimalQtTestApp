// Is the extension of this file .h or .h.in? Then read the suitable paragraph below.
/*  .h
        This is an automatically generated file by CMake. Do not edit!
        You can modify it indirectly by editing the pendant file with appended
        extension ".in". This usually can be found right next to your base
        CMakeLists.txt file.
    
    .h.in
        This is the source file that will undergo preprocessing by CMake.
        You can tailor this one to your needs.
        Note that you will need to re-run CMake.
